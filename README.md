# IPL

This is a project to implement a processor emulator for the programming language IPL, or Information Processing Language.  IPL was designed to prove the theorems of Principa Mathematica, was an inspiration for Lisp[1] and was mechanically tested.  It is thought it will be a simple enough machine to implement that is high level enough to be different and interesting.
