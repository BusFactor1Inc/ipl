# IPL

This is a project to implement a processor emulator for the programming language IPL, or Information Processing Language.  IPL was designed to prove the theorems of Principa Mathematica, was an inspiration for Lisp[1] and was mechanically tested.  It is thought it will be a simple enough machine to implement that is high level enough to be different and interesting.  It has a 'list processing' machine language.

The following book has been assembled from historical resources available on the Internet and will be used as reference materials for the design and programming of the IPL computer, and shall so forth be refernced as [TheBook]:
