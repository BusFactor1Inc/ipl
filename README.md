# IPL

This is a project to implement a 'switch level' processor simulator for the
programming language IPL, the "Information Processing Language".  IPL was
designed to prove the theorems of Principa Mathematica, was an
inspiration for Lisp[1] and was mechanically tested.  It is thought it
will be a simple enough machine to implement that is high level enough
to be different and interesting.  It has a 'list processing' machine
language.

The following book has been assembled from historical resources
available on the Internet and will be used as reference materials for
the design and programming of the IPL computer, and shall so forth be
referenced as ["The Book"](Information Processing Language - IPL - The
Book - 2017.pdf "\"The Book\""):

In preperation for the completion of this project, I have enrolled in
the following MitX Courses:

["Computation Structures - Part 1: Digital Circuits"](https://www.edx.org/course/computation-structures-part-1-digital-mitx-6-004-1x-0)

["Computation Structures 2: Computer Architecture"](https://www.edx.org/course/computation-structures-2-computer-mitx-6-004-2x
)

["Computation Structures 3: Computer Organization"](https://www.edx.org/course/computation-structures-3-computer-mitx-6-004-3x-0)

I will be using the content of these course to aid with the design and
implememtation of the tools required to build the simulator, which
will be designed and architected at the 'switch' level.  The simulator
and it's tools will be implememted in Common Lisp using
["LispWorks"](http://www.lispworks.com).  Portability to other Common
Lisps will be attempted, but not guaranteed.
