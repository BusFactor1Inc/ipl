# IPL

This is a project to implement a processor emulator for the programming language IPL, or Information Processing Language.  IPL was designed to prove the theorems of Principa Mathematica and was an inspiration for Lisp and was mechanically tested.  It is thought it will be a simple enough machine to implement that is high level enough to be different and interesting.
